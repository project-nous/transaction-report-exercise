# Nous Fullstack coding exercise

We have provided starting points for the exercise for both Backend and Frontend. Feel free to use these or if you are more familiar with other setups you can use your own.

## Backend

We have provided the skeleton of an Express server using NodeJS and Typescript.

## Frontend

We have provided a Typescript/React/Tailwind client scaffolded with Vite.

# How to run the App

- Install NodeJS
- Enable Corepack to add [`yarn`](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install) to your path `$ corepack enable`
- Install server dependencies `$ yarn`
- Install client dependences `$ cd web && yarn`
- Run the app from the root of this repository with `$ yarn dev`. The server will reload when any files in [src/](src/) are changed.
